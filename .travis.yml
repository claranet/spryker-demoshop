# Rationale:
#   - Build only within PRs
#   - Merge PRs and tag them in order to release a new version
#   - Tags representing released versions
#   - If tag matches the latest version configured here, the floating tag
#     `:latest` will be conferred to this particular image.
#   - PR are being built and tested, but not published
#   - Concurrency is disabled; Newer jobs are spooled 
#   - To share image between stages the intermediate product will be taged with
#     `:ci-$variant` and pushed to docker hub
